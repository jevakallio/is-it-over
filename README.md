## 🎈 is-it-over

🎈 [Made with PartyKit](https://docs.partykit.io)

I made this in like 5 minutes ok so don't look at the code too closely

## What's in there

[`server.ts`](./src/server.ts) is the server-side code, which is responsible for handling WebSocket events and HTTP requests. [`client.ts`](./src/client.ts) is the client-side code, which connects to the server and listens for events.

You can start developing by running `npm run dev` and opening [http://localhost:1999](http://localhost:1999) in your browser. When you're ready, you can deploy your application on to the PartyKit cloud with `npm run deploy`.
